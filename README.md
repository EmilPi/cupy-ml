# cupy-ml
Deep learning framework which leverages CUDA by use of python [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) library. If no CUDA available, it fallbacks to numpy.

It is developed
1. for the learning purposes;
2. to answer the question - how much some advanced cuDNN features like built-in kernels and operator fusion speed up (don't they?) training of ML models.
